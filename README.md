# Analyzing-Female-College-Completion-and-Computer-Science-Degrees-in-Virginia

"In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis using the 'College Scorecard' dataset to explore the relationship between the percentage of female students who completed their degrees within four years at Virginia institutions and the percentage of degrees awarded in Computer and Information Science and Support Services. The analysis revealed a weak or little connection between these variables, suggesting that factors other than gender may influence degree completion rates within this field.
